This is just a text on the first page. There is a HR tag inside the DIV to
visualise the pagebreak.
<DIV CLASS="PAGEBREAK"><HR></DIV>
This is the second page. You could also put some text inside the DIV tag.
<DIV CLASS="PAGEBREAK"><HR></DIV>
This is the third and final page. You could use another type of tag to use
the class in. DIV is just an example.
