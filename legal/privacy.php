<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>OUR DISCLOSURE OF 
  YOUR INFORMATION</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a matter of policy, we 
  do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their 
  marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes 
  some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal 
  scope of business to provide our services. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Internal Service Providers 
  for Our Operations. We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service 
  providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product 
  and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion 
  boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards) 
  and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these 
  internal service providers. These internal service providers' are subject to 
  confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit 
  their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to 
  facilitate the specific outsourced Silent Technology LLC related operation, 
  unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for 
  additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect 
  information directly from you (such as for Silent Technology LLC surveys or 
  for a co-branded credit card). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement 
  of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide 
  them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional 
  information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your 
  personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Legal Requests.</em> 
  Silent Technology LLC cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as 
  other third parties to enforce laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud, 
  and other rights, to help protect you and the Silent Technology LLC community 
  from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement 
  or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged 
  illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, 
  state, telephone number, email address without a subpoena. Without limiting 
  the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the 
  community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal 
  information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, 
  court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe 
  in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent 
  physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to the existing regulatory 
  environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other 
  personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described 
  in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), 
  we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third 
  parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept 
  or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse 
  your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although 
  we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, 
  and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications 
  will always remain private.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>OTHER INFORMATION 
  COLLECTORS</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Except as otherwise expressly 
  included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure 
  of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information 
  to other parties, on our site or other sites throughout the Internet, different 
  rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to 
  them. Since Silent Technology LLC does not control the privacy policies of third 
  parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage 
  you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>SECURITY</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your information is stored 
  on Silent Technology LLC Inc.'s servers located in the United States. We use 
  procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against 
  loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your 
  privacy, including encryption and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an 
  asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ 
  many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access 
  by users inside and outside the company. However, &quot;perfect security&quot; 
  does not exist on the Internet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>NOTICE</strong></font></p>
