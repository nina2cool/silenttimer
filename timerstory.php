<p><font color="#003399" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE 
  SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482; Story</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept 
  for <font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>THE SILENT 
  TIMER<font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8482;</font></strong></font> 
  was conceived by Erik McMillan and Mark Blecher, two <a href="http://www.utexas.edu" target="_blank">University 
  of Texas</a> seniors who saw a need that wasn&#8217;t being met.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every year 
  hundreds of thousands of high school and college graduates aspire to higher 
  levels of education. We have all heard the buzzwords: <strong>SAT</strong>, 
  <strong>ACT</strong>, <strong>LSAT</strong>, <strong>MCAT</strong>, <strong>GRE</strong>, 
  <strong>GMAT</strong>, and the list goes on. These are all tests that help students 
  get into their college or graduate school. One feature all of these standardized 
  tests share is stringent time control to measure how well and how quickly students 
  can answer tough questions. In fact, the most difficult part of these exams 
  is the time constraint. Most students, if given ample time, could finish most 
  questions correctly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since accomplishing
     higher levels of education is paramount to a student&#8217;s future success,
      income level, and life, big money is spent to learn how to take these tests.
      Students pay special test preparation schools such as <a href="http://www.review.com" target="_blank">The
       Princeton Review</a> or <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/" target="_blank">Kaplan</a> to learn how to beat their standardized
       exam. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Erik McMillan 
  and Mark Blecher both took <a href="handbook/standardizedtest/lsat/lsat_test_prep.php" target="_blank">an 
  LSAT class</a> in preparation for the June 2002 <a href="http://www.lsac.org">Law 
  School Admissions Test</a>. One of the major points stressed throughout the 
  course was to practice taking sample tests under real timing situations. To 
  do so students were urged to purchase a &#8220;<a href="timer/legal.php">legal</a>&#8221; 
  timer to help them keep time in practice and on test day. A &#8220;<a href="timer/legal.php">legal</a>&#8221; 
  timer is one that makes no noise and will not distract other students in the 
  testing situation. If a student&#8217;s timer makes noise during an examination, 
  the student will be asked to leave and will not be given a score on their test.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this in 
  mind, Erik and Mark set off to find a timer that would satisfy these requirements: 
  <strong>a timer that would guide them to a better score on their test</strong>. 
  They went to <a href="http://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank">Wal-Mart</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.target.com/">Target</a>, <a href="http://www.oshmans.com" target="_blank">Oshman&#8217;s</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.heb.com/" target="_blank">HEB</a>, <a href="http://www.albertsons.com/" target="_blank">Albertsons</a>, 
  and <a href="http://www.radioshack.com" target="_blank">Radio Shack</a> for 
  a timer that didn&#8217;t make any noise. The response they received from most 
  stores was, &#8220;<strong>Why would you want a timer that doesn&#8217;t make 
  a noise when it gets to zero</strong>&#8221;? After all, the main point of a 
  timer is to remind you when a certain amount of time has gone by.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea to 
  make a special <strong>standardized testing timer</strong> hit Erik on his trip 
  to Radio Shack. After asking where their timers were located, a Radio Shack 
  employee took Erik to the timers and explained which one most people had been 
  buying. Erik proceeded to ask if the noise could be disabled on the timer. The 
  employee told him that he was sorry, but a lot of other people were asking for 
  timers without noise as well and he didn&#8217;t know what to tell them. This 
  was the point of divine inspiration. Erik saw the problem, and also saw that 
  many others were experiencing the same problem. They needed a <a href="timer/legal.php">legal</a> 
  timer for their tests and they had nowhere to turn. Erik purchased the noisy 
  timer for <em><strong>$16.50</strong></em>, went home and removed the speaker 
  from Radio Shack&#8217;s non-legal device.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea has 
  come a long way from ripping sound out of Radio Shack timers. Erik and Mark 
  now have a patent pending on the only testing timer (<strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE 
  SILENT TIMER<font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8482;</font></font></strong>) 
  specifically made for standardized test takers on the market.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The timer is 
  equipped with unique features that make it an ideal study aid for many important 
  exams: it keeps track of test section time, lets the student know when time 
  is almost up, and even lets the student know how much time per question they 
  have left at any given point. <strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE 
  SILENT TIMER<font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8482;</font></font></strong> 
  is the key to developing the pacing skills students need to improve their performance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* <em>Test 
  rules for standardized exams vary. Check with your exam board to make sure The 
  Silent Timer&#8482; is legal for your test.</em></font></p>
