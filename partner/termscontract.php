  Program Terms and Conditions</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Partner Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) 
  contains the terms and conditions between Silent Technology LLC (&quot;Silent 
  Technology LLC&quot;, also referred to by the words &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; 
  and &quot;our&quot;) and you that apply to your application to participate and 
  to any subsequent participation as a Partner of Silent Technology LLC (&quot;Partner&quot;) 
  in Silent Technology LLC's Partner Program (the &quot;Partner Program&quot;). 
  If you are accepted as a Partner, this Agreement will describe the terms that 
  govern the establishment of links from your Web site that you identify in your 
  Partner Application (your &quot;Site&quot;) to Silent Technology LLC's Web site 
  at www.SilentTimer.com (the &quot;Silent Technology LLC Site&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By applying for the Partner 
  Program, you are confirming that you have read this Agreement, that it is a 
  legally binding document, and that you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions 
  contained in this Agreement. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>PLEASE 
  BE SURE TO PRINT A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR YOUR RECORDS.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. How to Become 
  a Partner</strong><br>
  To begin the enrollment process for our Partner Program, you will need to review 
  the terms of this Agreement and indicate your acceptance of these terms by checking 
  the box &#8220;Agree to Terms and Conditions&#8221; at the bottom of the application. 
  (If you do not check the box, you will not be considered for participation in 
  the Partner Program.) If you agree to the terms by checking the box, your application 
  will be submitted for review. We will evaluate it and notify you of your acceptance 
  or rejection. We may reject your application if we determine, in our sole discretion, 
  that your Site is unsuitable for our Partner Program for any reason, including, 
  but not limited to, business criteria that we may establish, or your inclusion 
  in your Site of content or links to content that we believe to be sexually explicit, 
  discriminatory, illegal, offensive, or infringing of third party intellectual 
  property rights. The acceptance notice will contain your partner program codes 
  and commission rates as well as other pertinent information for getting started.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. Partner Program 
  Overview</strong><br>
  We will make available to you for display on your Site a variety of graphic 
  and textual links (collectively referred to herein as &quot;Links&quot; or, 
  individually, as a &quot;Link&quot;). These Links are available through our 
  administrative partner program site located at www.silenttimer.com/partner (the 
  &quot;Partner Site&quot;). The Links will serve to identify your site as a member 
  of our Partner Program and will establish a link from your Site to the Silent 
  Technology LLC Site. When a visitor to your Site uses a Link to visit the Silent 
  Technology LLC Site, and makes a purchase meeting the criteria described in 
  the &quot;Commission Eligibility and Calculation&quot; section of this Agreement, 
  we will pay you commissions as described in this Agreement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. Commission Eligibility 
  and Calculation</strong><br>
  You will qualify for a commission for sales by us of certain qualifying products 
  (&quot;Qualifying Purchases&quot;) when all of the following conditions are 
  met:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Products are purchased 
    online within one month (30 days) from the time a customer links to the Silent 
    Technology LLC Site from a Link on your Site using the same computer system. 
    In addition, for a sale to qualify, the customer must not have responded to 
    any other marketing activity (such as clicking on a link in an email, on a 
    banner or portal advertisement, or on a Link on another Partner's site) subsequent 
    to clicking on a Link on your Site;</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">we have received full 
    payment, including payment for shipping, taxes, and any other charges.<br>
    </font></li>
</ol>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Commissions will be adjusted 
for product orders that are cancelled, undeliverable, returned, or where payment 
is otherwise refunded or recredited (including both full and partial refunds or 
recredits) to the purchaser (&quot;Customer Credits&quot;). We will adjust your 
account for Customer Credits on an ongoing basis, but at least monthly. If we 
have paid you a commission, and the Qualifying Purchase is subsequently the subject 
of a Customer Credit, the commission previously paid will be deducted from your 
account on an on-going basis but at least monthly. You will not receive a commission 
for any sales initiated or completed offline (for example, by telephone). Our 
determination of whether a commission is payable is final and is binding on you. 
</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commission rates will be 
  based on the aggregate amount actually paid to Silent Technology LLC for Qualifying 
  Purchases, excluding amounts collected by us for sales or other taxes, shipping, 
  and similar charges, amounts due to credit card fraud and bad debt, and Customer 
  Credits (&quot;Net Sales&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. Commission Payment 
  </strong><br>
  When the total commissions due to you (based on the requirements in the previous 
  section) meet or exceed $25, we will send you a commission check each month. 
  At the same time, we will send a statement of activity to you. Commission checks 
  and statements of activity will be sent within approximately 30 days after the 
  end of each month in which your account balance meets or exceeds $25. If the 
  balance of your account is less than $25, we will carry over the balance to 
  the next month. If, due to Customer Credits, your account with us is ever in 
  a negative balance, you agree to pay us the balance in collected funds immediately 
  upon demand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. Sales Reports</strong><br>
  You will be able to check your sales statistics through the Partner Site by 
  signing on with a password you specify. The data on the Partner Site will be 
  updated once daily, and will reflect data up to, but not including the prior 
  day; throughout the month, all Customer Credits will be reported and deducted 
  from Qualifying Purchases. All information available at the Partner Site, including 
  sales statistics, is our confidential information and is protected under the 
  &quot;Confidentiality&quot; section of this Agreement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>6. Responsibilities 
  of Silent Technology LLC</strong><br>
  We will be responsible for providing all information necessary to allow you 
  to establish Links from your Site to the Silent Technology LLC Site. We will 
  be responsible for processing each order placed by a customer following a Link 
  from your Site to the Silent Technology LLC Site, for tracking the Net Sales 
  for Qualifying Purchases generated by your Site, and for providing information 
  to you regarding sales statistics. We reserve the right to reject orders that 
  do not comply with any requirements that we may establish from time to time. 
  We will be responsible for all aspects of order processing and fulfillment, 
  including order entry, payment processing, shipping, cancellations, returns, 
  and related customer service.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Customers purchasing products 
  after linking to the Silent Technology LLC Site via the Links will be deemed 
  to be our customers. All of our rules, policies, terms, conditions and operating 
  procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, privacy and product 
  sales will apply to these customers. We may change our policies, terms, conditions 
  and operating procedures, including pricing, at any time. We solely will determine 
  the prices to be charged for products sold in accordance with our own pricing 
  policies. You may not include price information on your Site unless pricing 
  information is made available on Links we provide through the Partner Site. 
  Prices and availability of products may vary from time to time. We will use 
  commercially reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot 
  guarantee the availability or price of any particular product. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>7. Links and Content</strong><br>
  You must comply with the terms of this Agreement and any instructions on the 
  Partner Site in using the Links. To permit accurate tracking and reporting, 
  you will be responsible for ensuring that the Links are properly formatted. 
  In using our Links, you agree that you will cooperate fully with us in establishing 
  and maintaining such Links. You also agree that you will use only those images 
  or Links we provide to you via the Partner Site, and that you will substitute 
  such images or Links with any new images or Links provided by us from time to 
  time in accordance with our instructions. You shall display such graphic images 
  or Links prominently in relevant sections of your Site. In addition, we encourage 
  (but do not require) you to include a Link on the home page of your Site. Each 
  Link connecting users of your Site to the pertinent area of the Silent Technology 
  LLC Site must in no way alter the look, feel or functionality of the Silent 
  Technology LLC Site. A Link may only be modified and/or expanded with our prior 
  consent. We reserve the right to disable Links at any time without notice to 
  you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will not use any other 
  graphic or link to identify or refer to Silent Technology LLC or to link to 
  the Silent Technology LLC Site other than Links provided by us via the Partner 
  Site. You further agree that your Site will not, in any way, copy or resemble 
  the look and feel of the Silent Technology LLC Site and that you will not do 
  anything to create the impression that your Site is (or is a part of) the Silent 
  Technology LLC Site. Specifically, you agree that you will not frame the Silent 
  Technology LLC Site in any manner. You also hereby agree that your Site will 
  not contain any content of our Silent Technology LLC Site or any materials which 
  are proprietary to us, except 1) with our prior permission or 2) the materials 
  that are obtained via the Partner Site and used by you in accordance with the 
  terms of this Agreement and any associated instructions. You further hereby 
  agree that your domain name does not and will not contain any of the following 
  words: SilentTimer.com, Silent Technology LLC, or any variation or misspelling 
  thereof. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>8. Site Responsibility</strong><br>
  You are solely responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of 
  your Site, and for all materials that appear on your Site. Your responsibilities 
  include, but are not limited to (i) the technical operation of your Site and 
  all related equipment; (ii) the accuracy, legality and propriety of materials 
  posted on your Site, and (iii) ensuring that materials posted on your Site are 
  not libelous or defamatory. You agree that your Site will not contain content 
  that is sexually explicit, discriminatory, illegal, offensive, or infringing 
  of third party intellectual property rights, and acknowledge that we may terminate 
  this Agreement in the event your Site contains, or links to content that we 
  believe to be sexually explicit, discriminatory, illegal, offensive, or infringing 
  of third party intellectual property rights. In addition, you are responsible 
  for ensuring that your Site accurately and adequately discloses through a privacy 
  policy how you collect, use, store, and disclose data collected from visitors. 
  You are also solely responsible for ensuring that your Site complies with all 
  applicable intellectual property (including copyright) and other laws, and that 
  it does not infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of 
  any third party. You must have express permission to use another party's copyrighted 
  or other proprietary material. We will not be responsible if you use another 
  party's copyrighted or other proprietary material in violation of the law.</font></p>

  for all the matters set forth in the previous paragraph. Your obligations under 
  this section are subject to certain indemnification obligations described in 
  the &quot;Indemnification&quot; section of this Agreement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>9. Publicity </strong><br>
  Neither party shall (i) create, publish, distribute or permit any written material 
  which makes reference to the other party hereto without first submitting such 
  material to the other party and receiving the prior written consent of such 
  party, nor (ii) disclose to the public or any third party the relationship between 
  them or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without receiving the 
  prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
  withheld or delayed. Neither party hereto shall issue a press release describing 
  the relationship or the terms of this Agreement without the other party's prior 
  written approval. Neither party shall misrepresent the relationship between

    in this Agreement, without first submitting a sample of such to us and obtaining 
    our prior written consent, which we may withhold in our sole and absolute 
    discretion. You agree not to use the Silent Technology LLC Trademarks in any 
    manner that is disparaging or that otherwise portrays us in a negative light. 
    You shall not sublicense any of the Silent Technology LLC Trademarks. You

  each party shall return to the other party any confidential information of the 
  other party, and shall immediately cease to use any of the other party's trademarks

  Qualifying Purchases are not subject to Customer Credits. We may withhold your 
  final payment for a reasonable time to ensure that the correct amount is paid, 
  but no longer than three months (90 days). Such final payment will be made even 
  if the total amount of commissions is less than $25.</font></p>

  During the course of performance of this Agreement, we may disclose to you certain 
  business, technology, research, customer and other business information, including 
  trade secrets, which we consider to be and treat as confidential information, 
  (&quot;Confidential Information&quot;). You agree to maintain the Confidential 
  Information in confidence, and shall protect it with the same degree of protection 
  that you use to protect your own Confidential Information (which shall not be 
  less than reasonable care), shall not disclose it to any third party, and shall

  the foregoing, you may disclose such information as may be required by law or 
  governmental regulations or authority, provided, however, that prior to disclosure 
  of any information required by law or governmental regulations or authority, 
  you shall give prompt notice to us to allow us an opportunity to seek to protect 
  such Confidential Information. We may enforce your obligations under this section 
  with an injunction or other similar relief as provided in the &quot;Injunctive
