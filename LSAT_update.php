        and The Silent Timer - URGENT UPDATE </font></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><strong> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are
        taking the Feb. 4th LSAT, please read this important message: </font></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font size="2">1/27/06: Update from LSAC</font></strong></em></font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2005 we received several
    reports from students that their proctors wouldn&rsquo;t
  allow them to use their Silent Timer. Although quite rare &ndash; since thousands
  of LSAT students have successfully used their timers on test day &ndash; we
  decided to get the LSAT administrators (the LSAC) to officially sanction the
use of the Silent Timer. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this pursuit, we sent our product in for review in September of last year,
  and have been awaiting word on approval since that time. The only issue we
  were made aware of in this time period was that we should make sure that the
  timer did not create a distraction. So, when we manufactured our latest version,
  we made sure that distraction would not be an issue. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two days ago we received
    an email that said the LSAC had determined that the Silent Timer may give
    an unfair advantage to its user, and threatened to disallow its use on the
    February 4th test date. And, we immediately notified every student that
    had purchased a timer from us since October 2005. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Today we received an email
    that said that the decision to disallow the Silent Timer had &ndash; unbeknownst
    to us - been put into place in March 2005. Since that time, three LSATs have
  passed, with only a handful of cases where the Silent Timer was disallowed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Although it now appears
    less likely that your proctor will disallow use of your Silent Timer, we
    urge you to bring a back-up timer or watch to your test. And to do our part,
    we would like to offer to reimburse you for a suitable back-up timer purchased
    between now and February 4 (NOW EXPIRED). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Erik McMillan, Christina
McMillan, &amp; the rest of The Silent Timer Team </font></p>
