	<p><font color="#003399" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The
    Timer and Your Test </strong></font></p>
	
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE
SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482;</strong> was created especially for standardized
tests, so it has all the features you could want in a testing timer: silence,
time per question, count up and count down, and more. It is great for studying,
practicing, and great for test day (if allowed).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE
        SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482;</strong> is an invaluable practicing tool. It is so important
  to take practice tests under timed conditions. Use the timer  in your studying
  to simulate the time constraints of test day. You will be well prepared and
  ready to face the test, and time will be the least of your concerns. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some tests
    allow the use of timers during the actual test, and some do not. <strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE
  SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482;</strong> is legal for test day in that it is legal <em><strong>for
  tests that allow timers</strong></em> and, it is completely silent so it will not beep. Beeping
  timers are a great concern to proctors because they are very distracting.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the tests that
    do not allow timers (MCAT, GMAT, GRE, and ACT are among the tests that do
    not), use <strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE
    SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482;</strong> for practice. Even though you can't use the timer during the
    test, you now have months of practice with the same time conditions of test
    day. No more worrying, fretting, and stressing that you are going to run
    out of time - you have trained yourself to take the tests in the time given.
    You can concentrate on getting the questions correct, and that is what will
  get you higher scores. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just think, you'll be calm and able to concentrate, while other
  students are frantically bubbling in random answers and running out of time
  at the end. Don't worry, they'll learn their lesson for next time and use <strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font></strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE
  SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482;</strong></font>.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a warning,
    individual proctors are known to have their own rules and may be fussy about
    what can be brought into the testing room. It is very important that you
    contact your testing company and check with the proctor beforehand*. A proctor
    card is provided with the timer, and writing on the back of <strong><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">THE
    SILENT TIMER</font>&#8482;</strong> indicates that it is only a timer and
not a calculating device.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Check with
    your exam board to determine whether timers are allowed. You
    don't want to be surprised on test day! </font></p>
