<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The time is drawing near. 
  Every high school student looks forward to leaving home and going off to college 
  one day&#8212;well almost everyone. The need to find yourself and become an 
  independent person is driving you nuts, and if you have to listen to your mother 
  tell you one more time to make your bed or be home by 10:30 p.m., you&#8217;re 
  going to scream. Trust us, we&#8217;ve been there.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While you&#8217;re counting 
  down the minutes until the day you have your freedom, don&#8217;t forget that 
  you must first and foremost <em><strong>get accepted into college</strong></em>. 
  This means not monkeying around during high school as well as not letting senioritis 
  consume your senior year (not completely at least!).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sophomore year in high school 
  is a good time to start seriously thinking about college. It leaves you enough 
  time to research schools&#8217; requirements while allowing a couple years to 
  improve on whatever areas need work. Many high schools offer college nights, 
  usually during the fall semester, where colleges from all over visit and offer 
  information to prospective students. This is a good time to talk with the college 
  representatives about what their campus is like, their best programs, requirements 
  and any other questions you may have.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After you&#8217;ve found 
  out what the requirements are of some of the colleges you&#8217;re interested 
  in, take an active role in making sure you meet those. There&#8217;s usually 
  no ifs, ands or buts when it comes to meeting those requirements, so start your 
  research today. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your <strong>GPA</strong> 
  is one of the most important factors in determining college admission, so it&#8217;s 
  important to remember this all throughout high school. Though fun classes such 
  as Home Economics and Underwater Basket Weaving may be offered, don&#8217;t 
  take too many blow-off courses. Colleges will look at what classes you&#8217;ve 
  taken. A 3.5 with academically-challenging classes looks much better to university 
  admission committees than a 4.0 made up of no-brainer classes. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider taking some <strong>AP/honors</strong> 
  classes as well. They do require more work, but are excellent preparation for 
  college-level classes. You also have the option of taking <a href="../standardizedtest/other/highschool_tests.php">AP 
  placement tests</a>, which will earn you credit or advanced standing at most 
  of the nation&#8217;s colleges and universities. Don't let the AP tests pass 
  you by. When you take them, you get <em>OUT</em> of taking entire classes in 
  college.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Class rank can also be a 
  determining factor when applying to college. Some states like Texas, California 
  and Florida have even gone so far as to grant automatic admission to the top 
  tier of students based on class rank alone. A controversial tactic, students 
  lying within the necessary range of class ranks are given admission without 
  even having college entrance exam scores or other factors be part of the decision. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you don&#8217;t qualify 
  for automatic admission, rest assured that your <font color="#000000"><em><strong>entrance 
  exam scores</strong></em></font> will lie heavily in deciding whether or not 
  you&#8217;ll get into your college of choice. These exams are mostly testing 
  skills that can be learned, so it is highly possible for you to score high if 
  you <a href="index.php">properly prepare yourself</a>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though grades and test scores 
  are what colleges may look at first, they also look to see what extracurricular 
  activities you&#8217;re involved in. Universities generally want well-rounded 
  students&#8212;not all bookworms that stay in to study on Friday nights. Academic 
  organizations and leadership roles are particularly good to have on your resume. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you know what you would 
  like to major in&#8212;great! If not, that&#8217;s okay, too, but it will help 
  you in choosing the right college. Look to see which academic institutions offer 
  the best programs for what you&#8217;re interested in. Consider their academic 
  reputation, size, location, selectivity, financial aid availability and social 
  atmosphere. Be sure to visit their campus as well so you&#8217;ll have an idea 
  of where you might spend the next four years of your life. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember that the early 
  bird gets the worm, so apply to about three schools as soon as you can&#8212;one 
  of them being a safety school in case things don&#8217;t work out the way you 
  plan. You never know when your organization will pay off. Think optimistically, 
  and good luck!</font></p>
