<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&#8217;s your worst nightmare. 
  You wake up one morning to realize you forgot to set your alarm. In a panic, 
  you fall over rushing to get dressed and speed like a maniac to school. Panting 
  and out of breath, you scramble to your unwelcoming classroom seat, and once 
  you think the worst is over, you look up to realize it&#8217;s SAT day and you 
  haven&#8217;t even begun to study. Relax, it&#8217;s only that&#8212;a nightmare.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether you plan to take 
  the <a href="../standardizedtest/sat/">SAT</a>, <a href="../standardizedtest/gmat/">GMAT</a> 
  or any other standardized exam, test anxiety can be a killer. If you allow yourself 
  adequate time to fully prepare for the test, however, you can overcome this 
  apprehension and focus on increasing your scores in the process. There are countless 
  resources available designed to help test takers study for these exams. Prep 
  courses, training software, practice tests and timers are only a few examples 
  of the endless list of study aids. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For students who have a 
  severe case of test anxiety or need professional help in learning test-taking 
  strategies, look into taking a prep course. Trained experts coach these courses, 
  which can be truly beneficial for individuals who have a hard time knowing where 
  to begin studying for an exam and need personal guidance in their preparation. 
  Reputable companies hosting a variety of prep courses include <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com" target="_blank">The 
  Princeton Review</a>, <a href="http://www.kaptest.com/" target="_blank">Kaplan 
  Test Prep and Admissions</a> and <a href="http://study-smart.com" target="_blank">Advantage 
  Education</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you want to clearly identify 
  your weaknesses to demonstrate where you need improvement, take a practice test. 
  Then take another one. And another one and another one. Practice exams are an 
  ideal way to increase your scores. It&#8217;s like rehearsing for the big one; 
  you can&#8217;t go wrong taking a practice test. You can find these exams almost 
  anywhere. Check out your local bookstore for informative prep books that will 
  guide you through whatever exam you&#8217;re taking&#8212;practice tests will 
  most likely be included in these books. You can also search on <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> 
  by typing in &#8220;(Test name) practice test.&#8221; Links upon links will 
  be returned with many tests available. Some of these tests will be free, while 
  some may be very expensive. Just make sure you check out the source before you 
  spend too much money on a so-called practice test from an unreputable Web site. 
  Sometimes you will also receive practice test materials from the testing service 
  when you register for the test. Get your hands on any practice test you can. 
  What have you got to lose?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Know the test format before 
  test day. This alone will help in increasing your scores by saving you time 
  and confusion. You can look online or in practice materials given to you by 
  the testing service or prep courses for information about what skills will be 
  tested, what order the sections will be in, test directions, the number of questions, 
  time allotted to each section and even how the scoring works. By simply becoming 
  familiar with the format of the test, you will feel much more comfortable on 
  actual test day.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having good <a href="../timemanagement/index.php">time 
  management</a> is also a key component to increasing your scores. Most of these 
  exams, if not all of them, determine admission into a specific program. Therefore, 
  how you prepare yourself and prioritize your time could make or break your chances. 
  Good <a href="../timemanagement/index.php">time management</a> is crucial to 
  getting that acceptance letter.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last, but not least, maintain 
  a positive attitude. Hold your head high and let your determination lead the 
  way while preparing yourself for the exam. Optimism equals success. How could 
  anyone who doesn&#8217;t believe in themselves do well on anything? Start yourself 
  on a positive track today. Surround yourself with encouraging thoughts and people. 
  Set goals and reach them. You can increase your scores, and you will increase 
  your scores. Believe in yourself.</font></p>
