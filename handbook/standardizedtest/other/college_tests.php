        four nights a week, spring break trips with your closest friends, meeting
        your soul mate&#8230;the 
  best years of your life will be spent in college, right?</font></strong> Well, you still have 
  your whole life ahead of you when you finally graduate, but by all means, make 
  the most of your college years. If you want to get a decent job and make a living 
  for yourself, however, you better not spend too much time away from the books 
  or preparing for your future.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By now you should have
    developed  your personal study style that works best for you. You&#8217;ve
    earned your  place in college, but now you need to focus on getting out (graduating).
    Though  some students may wish to prolong college life and avoid adulthood
    as long as  possible, graduation will come someday and you will have to figure
    out how to  survive in this world as a financially independent and responsible
    adult.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If, in the end, you decide
     graduate school may be in the stars for you, it&#8217;s time to start thinking
      about more entrance exams. If you plan on being a doctor, lawyer, business
     C.E.O.,  professor or any other executive with a higher degree, additional
     schooling  is required.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Graduate entrance exams 
  include the <a href="../mcat/">MCAT</a>, <a href="../bar/">BAR exam</a>, <a href="../lsat/">LSAT</a>, 
  <a href="../gre/">GRE</a> and <a href="../gmat/">GMAT</a> . Though all seemingly 
  very different exams, many test similar skills that can be learned.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">College tests require thorough 
  preparation and a planned-out study process. Cramming will not produce your 
  best test scores, reflecting poorly on your GPA. Remember that your GPA will 
  be a major factor in deciding admission to graduate school.</font></p>
