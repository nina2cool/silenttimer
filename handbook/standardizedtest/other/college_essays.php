<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting into college these 
  days doesn&#8217;t just require good grades and test scores&#8212;you also
  must demonstrate that you can think critically and express your ideas and opinions
  in an organized and professional manner.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#33CC33">Ah&#8230;college
        essays.</font></strong> The adversary 
    of many high school students struggling to form an opinion of their own in a 
    world encompassed by numerous views on different subjects, much less convey 
    their thoughts in a well thought-out way.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your college application 
  packets should include what each individual university is looking for in an 
  essay as well as topic choices. These topics could range from describing a humorous 
  experience you&#8217;ve had to writing about a life experience that&#8217;s 
  influenced you and changed your personal growth. The main purpose of the college 
  essay is to demonstrate to an admissions committee what kind of person you are 
  and share something of yourself not reflected in your academic records. It could 
  be the deciding factor of your admissions decision.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point is that you should 
  not take these college essays lightly&#8212;some institutions view them as the 
  second most important step in the college application process after the SAT. 
  Your college essays should be something you take advantage of to promote yourself 
  when applying to college. You have time to brainstorm, write, critique and rewrite 
  many times.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your college essay should
     be composed of three sections: the introduction, body and conclusion. Seems
     obvious, right? Not to everyone.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <strong>introduction</strong> should
        capture the reader&#8217;s
            attention. Tell a joke, reveal a surprising statistic-- whatever
        it takes to make the reader look twice. Try to avoid summarizing the
        essay in the introduction; the reader will have no incentive to read
        the rest of the paper.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <strong>body</strong> should communicate
      your ideas in an organized fashion. The key here is to make sure you have
      smooth transitions, which move your reader from paragraph to paragraph.
      Coming up with good transitions can be very difficult for some students,
      so be sure to spend some time tweaking these components.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, the <strong>conclusion</strong>    should reemphasize your views and leave a lasting impression on your
  reader. You want the admissions committee to remember you, not stack your
  essay with all the other uninteresting, boring college essays they have
  to peruse through.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember that you&#8217;re 
  not necessarily writing a persuasive essay, and you don&#8217;t need to convince 
  the reader to take your position. You should, however, be able to support your 
  argument or opinion with valid statements or stories. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When writing your essay, 
    <em>be honest</em>. You would be surprised how many students embellish or exaggerate 
  on their college essays. They&#8217;re unbelievable and sound ridiculous. You 
  want your college of choice to clearly see why you would make an exceptional 
  addition to their student body and accept you for who you are. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, <strong>use specific
      examples</strong>  for broad statements. For example, that&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve proven 
  yourself to be one of the most intelligently creative students on your high 
  school campus, but how? What have you done? Tell the reader a story. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most importantly, start 
  writing your college essay early! Write several drafts and receive critiques 
  from different sources. Remember, though, that you don&#8217;t want these sources 
  to write your essay; you just want to make sure you&#8217;re not rambling on 
  without organization. </font></p>
