<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just when you think you&#8217;ve
     got it made, life turns around and throws another obstacle your way. You&#8217;ve
      graduated college or are nearing college graduation when you learn about
     a certification  test that&#8217;s either been recommended or required of
     you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many professions have certification
     requirements, including nurses, therapists, teachers, accountants, information
     technology professionals and more. If you don&#8217;t pass some of these
     professional  tests, you will not be certified to do your job. Some professions
     are even requiring  extended education and ongoing certification tests. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other
      professions, like information technology, don&#8217;t necessarily require
      certification  in certain areas, but recommend it. With certification you
      will gain industry  recognition, making you more marketable to your competitors.
      Relax&#8212;even 
  if you haven&#8217;t taken college courses in a while, there are resources
  available  to help you.</font></p>
