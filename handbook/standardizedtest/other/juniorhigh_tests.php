<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Junior High Tests</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So many things happen in 
  junior high&#8212;you&#8217;re introduced to rushing to a different class every 
  hour, learning how to open a lock that never seems to work and mingling with 
  different kids from the ones you&#8217;ve played with since kindergarten. Now 
  you&#8217;re also expected to learn how to take on a more mature role as far 
  as studying goes since tests have also changed. They&#8217;ve gotten more difficult.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Junior high tests begin 
  to require more in-depth memorization and a real thought process. Students are 
  expected to be able to retain information and apply it to real life situations 
  when it comes to testing. See below for <a href="#Study">study strategies</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The major exams that junior
     high students will have to face are statewide tests. Every state, except
    for  Iowa and Nebraska, has statewide testing programs and even requires
    passing  scores to advance to the next grade level in some states. Though
    these tests  measure students&#8217; basic educational skills such as mathematics,
    English  and reading, they also play a large part in evaluating the teaching
    effectiveness  of both teachers and school districts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some additional junior high 
  tests you may take include high school entrance exams, including the Secondary 
  School Admission Test (SSAT), Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE) and Specialized 
  High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT). Contact your school guidance counselor 
  to determine if you will have to take any of these exams.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>SSAT</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="http://www.ssat.org" target="_blank">SSAT</a> 
  evaluates whether students meet the criteria for success in competitive secondary 
  schools by testing students&#8217; skill level in core subject areas. Two 150 
  minute versions of the test are available, all measuring math, verbal and reading 
  comprehension abilities along with one unscored section. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ISEE</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ISEE is used to determine 
  admission to private high schools by measuring students&#8217; abilities in 
  key subject areas. Three versions of the three hour standardized test are given, 
  analyzing students&#8217; mathematics, verbal and writing skills. The ISEE lower 
  level is given to students in the fourth and fifth grades, the middle level 
  is given to students in the sixth and seventh grades and the upper level is 
  given to students between the eighth and 11th grades.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Junior high students are
    not typically prepared well enough at their level to write thorough and well
    thought-out essays. Some extra time may have to be spent tweaking their writing
    skills. Contact a freelance proofreader today to ensure a high score on this portion of the exam (link 
  to www.kdlady.com).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ISEE test dates vary from 
  state to state. For specific test dates and registration information, visit 
  www.erbtest.org, or call 1-800-446-0320 to receive a mail-in registration form.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>SHSAT</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SHSAT is strictly given 
  to New York residents in the eighth and ninth grades. Visit <a href="http://www.nycenet.edu" target="_blank">www.nycenet.edu</a>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="Study"></a>Study Strategies</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since middle school testing
     begins to significantly differ from elementary school testing, the transition
     can be an abrupt one. However, there are many ways to prepare for this change
     and develop good study habits in the process. First of all, students should
     gather all materials needed to study for the test, including notes, quizzes,
     textbooks, etc. Having all this information at your disposal will help to
    minimize  time when referring from one study aid to the next.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students should use this
     time to develop a study style as well. Whether it be alone, with friends
    or  parents or creating flashcards, experiment with different study methods
    to find  out which works best for you. Some students will find they can&#8217;t
    concentrate  on their personal needs when working with other students while
    others may find  it helps to get answers to questions not thought of.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask teachers for study suggestions. 
  They realize students are focusing on studying for possibly the first time and 
  have great recommendations for ways to absorb information best. Teachers may 
  even tell you which areas to concentrate on. Who wants to spend 30 minutes studying 
  for a section in which only one question was asked?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As usual, get a good night&#8217;s 
  rest and eat a good breakfast in the morning. Studies have shown that these 
  two strategies alone should significantly improve your alertness and ability 
  to recall information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the actual test, be sure 
  to listen and read the instructions well. You don&#8217;t want to make a stupid 
  mistake because you rushed through the directions. You shouldn&#8217;t have 
  to worry about this if you pace yourself on the exam. Using </font><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><a href="../../silent_timer/index.php"><font color="#000066">THE

  when studying and taking practice tests will help you feel more comfortable 
  when it comes to the actual test. You will have already figured out how many 
  minutes per question you may spend, saving you time and stress. You also don&#8217;t 
  want to be left scribbling answers when the bell rings with unanswered questions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, don&#8217;t forget
     to review your answers when you&#8217;re finished if you have time.</font></p>
