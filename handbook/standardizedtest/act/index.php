<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting accepted into your 
  dream college can be a tough thing, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. The ACT 
  Assessment&reg; (ACT) test is designed to make it easier for potential college 
  students to gain admission into their choice schools by basing much of the test 
  on high school curriculum. Universities typically weigh standardized test scores 
  pretty heavily when it comes to admissions, but if you paid attention in high 
  school, the ACT test should be one of the simpler tasks in your college preparation 
  adventure.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 215 question half-day 
  standardized college entrance exam, the ACT test measures students&#8217; general 
  educational progress and ability to handle college level coursework. The exam 
  covers English, mathematics, reading and science and takes an interest inventory 
  helpful for career and educational planning.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why take the ACT test instead 
  of the SAT test? The ACT test is required by more four-year colleges than any 
  other college entrance exam, including the SAT. There is also no penalty for 
  wrong answers on the ACT, and it is more straightforward than the SAT. Because 
  the ACT is based on high school courses, students usually feel more comfortable 
  with it than other standardized tests.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An optional 30-minute Writing 
  Test component has recently been added to the ACT. Some schools may require 
  this part of the exam, some may not. You can check to see which colleges require 
  the Writing Test <a href="http://actrs19.act.org/app3/writPrefRM/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  Both versions of the exam will be available to students. If your college of 
  choice happens to require this portion of the exam, it would be wise to fully 
  prepare yourself. Contact a freelance proofreader today to ensure a high score 
  on this portion of the exam.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration is easy. Students 
  can either <a href="http://www.actstudent.org/regist/" target="_blank">do it 
  online</a> or by phone at 1-800-525-6926. Standby testing is also available. 
  Check at your high school for student registration packets.</font></p>
