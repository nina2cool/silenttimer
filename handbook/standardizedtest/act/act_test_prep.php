<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let the ACT test be your 
  first glimpse into college life as far as preparing sufficiently for an exam 
  before test day. Sure, the exam may not be too complicated if you paid attention 
  in high school, but no one ever said you didn&#8217;t have to study for it. 
  ACT prep is just as important as taking the test. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the obvious ways 
  to prepare yourself to take the ACT test is a prep course. Many of these courses 
  offer personal tutoring, online and classroom courses. Some to look at include 
  <a href="http://www.kaptest.com/repository/templates/Lev3InitDroplet.jhtml?_lev3Parent=/www/KapTest/docs/repository/content/College/ACT" target="_blank">Kaplan 
  Test Prep and Admissions</a>, <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college/testprep/testprep.asp?TPRPAGE=2&amp;TYPE=ACT" target="_blank">Princeton 
  Review</a> and <a href="http://www.testprep.com/" target="_blank">Triumph College 
  Admissions</a>. You may also consider the ACT's official prep program, <a href="http://www.actstudent.org/onlineprep/index.html" target="_blank">ACT 
  Online Prep&#8482;</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most importantly, make sure 
  that you prepare yourself ahead of time to be able to meet the college application 
  deadlines; you don&#8217;t want to be rushing at the last minute to get the 
  test scores in.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you take the ACT test 
  the first time as a junior, one of the best things you can do for ACT prep is 
  to take a course your senior year in the area you scored the lowest in. This 
  strategy alone should easily improve your score and give you more confidence 
  when taking the test the next time. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ACT prep cannot be done 
  without enough rest and healthy meals. Make sure you don&#8217;t stress yourself 
  out, and always keep a positive attitude. Remember, too, that the test may be 
  taken more than once&#8212;just don&#8217;t slack off in studying for it just 
  because you&#8217;re too lazy to do your best the first time!</font></p>
