<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hardest aspect of the 
  SAT is the strict time limit. The trick to conquering the SAT is not related 
  to what grades you made in high school, or even prior knowledge you acquired 
  before test day. No, the trick to the SAT is knowing the test inside and out 
  and having a strategy for maximizing the number of correct answers in a limited 
  amount of time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep in mind that SAT questions
    are organized in an order of increasing difficulty: the easier questions
    are found at the beginning of each test section and become increasingly difficult
    as you move through the section. Aim to answer the easier questions correctly
    to bank points that are sure to increase your score. Also consider that if
    you generally aren't in the 90th percentile of SAT takers (based on your
    practice tests), you might want to skip the really difficult questions. Why
    try to answer a question that only 5 percent of test takers will answer correctly,
  especially if it will hurt your score in two ways:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. You miss the 
  question, and missing questions on the SAT counts against you, unlike most standardized 
  tests. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. You spend a lot 
  of time on the question, and now you don't have enough time on the rest of your 
  test to answer other questions that may be more manageable.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font color="#000000">T</font></strong></em><font color="#000000"><strong><em>ime 
  management</em></strong> is an important factor in your test taking strategy. 
  </font>While practicing for your test, always time yourself as if you are in 
  the actual test. Doing this will ensure that you learn the pacing skills necessary 
  to answer all of the &quot;manageable&quot; questions, and give you the extra 
  time you may need to tackle the more difficult ones. </font></p>

  that will help you learn not to spend too much time on any one question. It 
  lets you know how much time on average you have to answer each question. And 
  based on how quickly you are answering questions, it recalculates the amount 
  of time you have on future questions. By practicing with this innovative study 
  tool, you can work on improving your pacing before you even step foot in the 
  test room. Remember, &quot;Success is Just a Matter of Time....&quot;</font></p>
