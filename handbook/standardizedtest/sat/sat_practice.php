<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Would you jump into the 
  middle of the ocean with scuba gear but no skills to scuba dive? No, you would 
  be stranded in the middle of the ocean with a bunch of gear and no skills to 
  get out. Sounds silly, but if you don&#8217;t prepare yourself and learn the 
  skills needed to take the SAT test, you, too, will be stranded in a classroom 
  with testing material and no knowledge to take the test.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAT questions are created 
  to test your reasoning ability and time efficiency skills, <em><strong>not your 
  intelligence</strong></em>. Therefore, the exam is a measure of demonstrated 
  skills that can be learned. The key here is <strong><em>practice</em></strong> 
  and following some practical advice:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. <font color="#000099"><strong>Challenge 
  yourself academically</strong></font>. Practice for the SAT begins with your 
  high school courses. Challenging yourself and taking more advanced courses will 
  help you build a solid basis for problem solving and reasoning. It has been 
  proven that students who take more advanced classes and earn higher grades generally 
  do better than the opposite. High school is no time to take blow-off courses 
  if you wish to succeed on the SAT test. Underwater basket weaving will not get 
  you an 800 on the math or verbal section. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. <font color="#000099"><strong>Read 
  constantly</strong></font>. Read journals and books to help improve your <a href="sat_vocabulary.php">vocabulary</a> 
  for the verbal section. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">3. <strong><font color="#000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take 
  practice SAT tests</font></strong>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Make 
  sure you get a feel for the exam by taking several <a href="sat_practice_test.php">practice 
  SAT tests</a>. Spend time reviewing sample questions and the test directions 
  to save you time. </font></font></p>
<p><font size="2">4</font>.<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  <a href="sat_st.php">Learn to pace yourself</a>. Also take the SAT I: Reasoning 
  Test, which should be available at all high schools. Other test materials should 
  be available at school or at your local public library.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAT practice is very important 
  in doing well on the SAT test. Reasoning skills may be learned with practice 
  and the right training.</font></p>
