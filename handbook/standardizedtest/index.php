<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No matter how old you are, 
  you&#8217;ve taken one. Your best friend&#8217;s taken one. Your doctors, teachers 
  and even your parents have taken one. You&#8217;ve probably taken several of 
  them. Whether it&#8217;s to advance grade levels, obtain admission into a college 
  program or determine your eligibility to become a lawyer, there&#8217;s no avoiding 
  standardized tests. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the <em>Handbook 
  for Measurement and Evaluation in Early Childhood Education</em>, a simple set 
  of criteria classifies these inevitable exams:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They include specified 
    procedures for administration and scoring.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Test items result from 
    experience by experiment or observation rather than theory.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They have an established 
    format and set of materials.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They present the same 
    tasks and require the same response modes from all test takers.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common standardized tests 
  include the <a href="bar/">BAR Exam</a>, <a href="act/">ACT</a>, <a href="sat/">SAT</a>, 
  <a href="lsat/">LSAT</a>, <a href="mcat/">MCAT</a>, <a href="gre/">GRE</a> and 
  <a href="gmat/">GMAT</a>. Middle school and high school students must also take 
  state standardized tests. Students are trained from early adolescents to take 
  these exams&#8212;they are unavoidable.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much controversy surrounds 
  standardized tests. Experts from different sides debate how effective the tests 
  are in truly measuring students&#8217; intelligence and whether they&#8217;re 
  a fair tool for students spanning across extremely diverse backgrounds.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary argument of 
  those favoring standardized tests is that the test results can be quantified 
  and compared. Grade point average scales and level of academic difficulty differ 
  from school to school. What is a 3.0 at a highly-academically ranked school 
  might be a 4.0 at a school not as academically challenging. Because there is 
  no common method in evaluating students, standardized test scores are aimed 
  at providing academic institutions a universal scale in which to measure students&#8217; 
  knowledge and skills.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents, educators and politicians 
  also like to use standardized test to determine how successful a particular 
  school is teaching various subjects. Teachers are encouraged to base their curriculum 
  plans around the students&#8217; strengths and weaknesses derived from the tests 
  to increase scores.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The public also generally 
  feels better going to a doctor or lawyer that has passed a legitimate skill 
  and knowledge test. Who wants to have open-heart surgery performed by someone 
  whose skills aren&#8217;t based on a common measuring ground? For all you know, 
  Dr. What&#8217;s-his name could have graduated from Coo Coo Medical School.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other side of the 
  argument lies those opposing standardized tests claiming that the exam scores 
  are not a true measurement of intelligence and exclude artistic skills and critical 
  thinking. At the forefront of the line is the <a href="http://www.fairtest.org" target="_blank">National 
  Center for Fair and Open Testing</a> that doesn&#8217;t think standardized tests 
  are fair and helpful assessment tools because they reward the ability to quickly 
  answer questions not involving an actual thought process. A big part of its 
  views on standardized testing is that the only objective part of the exams is 
  the scoring done by a machine. Everything else, such as the questions, question 
  wording, determination of the &#8220;correct answer&#8221; and rules, is done 
  by subjective human beings. The center urges that good teacher observation, 
  documentation of student work and performance-based assessment will much better 
  determine students&#8217; abilities.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe someday proponents 
  from both sides will be able to come together and reach some sort of agreement 
  on a universal way to measure students&#8217; abilities, but until then standardized 
  tests seem to be the only obvious alternative. <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/%7Eram7t/345/wpdocs.htm" target="_blank">Learn
