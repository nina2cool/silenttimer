<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you already know, after 
  taking the LSAT and going through LAW school, the BAR exam is all that stands 
  between you and your dream of living out the life of a smooth-talking, successful 
  lawyer. The test is NOT easy and demands memorization, dedication, sweat, tears 
  and much much more.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to be successful, 
  you need to have a good understanding of what the <a href="index.php">test is 
  all about</a>, how it is structured and also: <strong><font size="3"><em>make 
  sure you practice good time management</em></font></strong>. Before your test 
  and during practice, learn how much time you are going to have per test section. 
  Also, know how many questions you will have to answer in this specified time. 
  This information allows you to deduce the amount of time you may spend on each 
  individual question on your test.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to fully get a 
  grasp on your test time, as well as give yourself the edge you deserve: invest

  is a timer that will help you learn not to spend too much time on any one question 
  and is silent so you can use it on test day. It lets you know how much time 
  on average you have to answer each question. And based on how quickly you are 
  answering certain question types, it recalculates the amount of time you have 
  on future questions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to avoid the traps 
  of difficult question types, always be aware of how much time you have spent 
  on your current question. If you notice you have spent too much time, then your 
  time will be better used going on to other questions and returning to the difficult 
  ones later.</font></p>
