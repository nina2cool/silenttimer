<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So after all your exhausting 
  work through law school, you still have one major component to pass before you 
  can even practice law. If you don&#8217;t pass, you don&#8217;t practice. No 
  pressure, right? Well, at least you have time to prepare. If you correctly prepare 
  yourself for the BAR exam, you should be among the six to seven of every 10 
  test takers that passes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To assist you in getting 
  ready for the BAR exam, NBCE occasionally releases actual questions that have 
  been withdrawn from use as a study aid to applicants. These publications range 
  from a meager $12 to $25. The MEE study aids range from free on the <a href="http://www.ncbex.org/pub.htm" target="_blank">NBCE 
  Web site</a> to $60. The MPRE is also free on the <a href="http://www.ncbex.org/pub.htm" target="_blank">NBCE 
  Web site</a> and goes up to a measly $17.50. Last but not least, the MPT varies 
  from free on the <a href="http://www.ncbex.org/pub.htm" target="_blank">NBCE 
  Web site</a> to $20. The publication order form can also be downloaded from 
  the <a href="http://www.ncbex.org/pub.htm" target="_blank">NBCE Web site</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the first things 
  you should do when beginning to study for the BAR exam is get the application 
  to the state you wish to be admitted in and determine what is necessary for 
  admission. To be really ahead of the game, take courses in the subjects covered 
  by the BAR exam.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many law professors suggest 
  taking a BAR exam preparation course. This review course will not only supply 
  you with the updated version of the law tested on a given bar exam, but it will 
  also help you to develop study skills and test-taking methods. Practice makes 
  perfect. A few places to start your search for a good prep course are <a href="http://www.thebarexam.com/index.htm" target="_blank">AmeriBar 
  Bar Review</a>, the <a href="http://www.patentbarbri.com/course/course_frameset.htm" target="_blank">BAR/BRI 
  Patent Bar Course</a> and the <a href="http://www.thestudygroup.com" target="_blank">Study 
  Group Personal Bar Review</a>. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most importantly, maintain 
  a positive attitude and stay away from negative influences. If you go in with 
  a pessimistic mindset, you&#8217;ve already lost half your chance before you&#8217;ve 
  even started. Keep a regular study schedule, and don&#8217;t get distracted 
  by unnecessary temptations. Form a fan club, and start cheering yourself on 
  today.</font></p>
