<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So you want to practice 
  law. You&#8217;ve taken the LSAT and survived through almost three years of 
  grueling law school. As you approach your last year, you think you&#8217;ve 
  got it made, and then a chiming voice rings in the back of your head, reminding 
  you of one last challenge-- &#8220;the BAR exam.&#8221; </font></p>
                  
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&#8217;s right, 
        the BAR examination-- hopefully the last requirement you must pass before 
        you can officially call yourself a lawyer. Almost all law school graduates 
        need to apply for bar admission through their state board of bar examiners 
        to obtain a license for law practice. This admission typically consists 
        of a two-day BAR exam and review of all applicants&#8217; character and 
        fitness.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the first day of 
        the BAR exam, applicants take the Multistate Bar Examination, which is 
        a standardized six hour 200 multiple choice test covering six areas: Constitutional 
        Law, Contracts, Criminal Law, Evidence, Real Property and Torts. Developed 
        by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, the MBE is divided into two 
        periods of three hours each (one in the morning and one in the afternoon 
        of the test day). The questions are created for test takers to apply fundamental 
        legal principles instead of a local case or statutory law.</font></p>
      
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second day of the BAR 
  exam is when locally crafted essays from a broader range of subject matters 
  may be used. Several states, however, have increasingly begun using two nationally 
  developed tests, the <a href="bar_other.php">Multistate Essay Examination</a> 
  and the <a href="bar_other.php">Multistate Performance Test</a>, to finish the 
  BAR examination. Almost all jurisdictions are also requesting <a href="bar_other.php">Multistate 
  Professional Responsibility Examination</a> scores, which is separately administered 
  three times a year.</font></p>
      
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BAR exam scores are based 
  on the number of questions answered correctly, and credit is given when applicants 
  select the best answer.</font></p>
