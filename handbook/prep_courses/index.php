<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A <em>prep course</em> is 
  a program coached by trained professionals designed to guide students in their 
  preparation for an upcoming standardized test. Many of them offer various services, 
  including online classes, personal tutoring and physical classroom training.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&#8217;s a prep course 
  for every possible test&#8212;the <a href="../standardizedtest/sat/">SAT</a>, 
  <a href="../standardizedtest/act/">ACT</a>, <a href="../standardizedtest/gre/">GRE</a>, 
  <a href="../standardizedtest/gmat/">GMAT</a>, <a href="../standardizedtest/mcat/">MCAT</a>, 
  <a href="../standardizedtest/lsat/">LSAT</a>, DAT, CPA, <a href="../standardizedtest/bar/">BAR</a>, 
  etc. Chances are that whatever test you&#8217;re preparing to take, there&#8217;s 
  a prep course for it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Test preparation courses 
  help students learn methods to score well on their standardized tests. Most 
  tests can be 'learned,' and a prep course is one of the easiest, most beneficial 
  ways to learn the tricks of any test you take. By learning the test's format, 
  practicing certain methods, and taking practice tests, a student WILL perform 
  at a higher level.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A preparation course puts 
  all of the following tools at a students finger tips:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">proven test techniques</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">practice tests</font></li>

  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">test advice</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and much, much more</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A test prep company is a 
  great choice to help you get familiar with your test. By only sitting in class, 
  listening to your instructor who has scored in the 98% percentile for your exam 
  will increase your chances of getting a higher score. If you have problems on 
  study questions or test problems, your prep teacher can help you get through 
  it. They are your personal test guides and will keep you on the path to success.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Why a Prep Course 
  is a Great Testing Tool<br>
  </strong>Fifty percent of all test takers score average on a standardized test. 
  If you score in this fifty percent range, you will find it extremely difficult 
  to maintain a competitive admissions edge to your college or graduate program 
  of choice. By only answering two to three more questions correctly on your exam, 
  you can jump to the eighty percent level. So, by studying a little harder and 
  having the guiding hand of test professionals, you can leap over thirty percent 
  of your competition. That is a huge jump, and chances are, you will get more 
  than just three more questions correct by taking a prep class. Remember that 
  <a href="../timemanagement/index.php">time management</a> is also extremely 
  important for increasing your test scores. Improving your time management strategies 
  coupled with taking a highly qualified test prep course will put you on the 
  track to testing success.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studying for an entrance 
  exam is definitely something that cannot be put off. Most testing companies 
  suggest students begin studying for the exam several months in advance; some 
  even recommend starting a year before the possible test date. If you&#8217;re 
  enrolled in a prep course, your teacher will help guide your study patterns 
  and provide a structured approach to learning.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If <em><strong>test anxiety</strong></em> 
  is a problem for you, a prep course should help you conquer this trouble. Coaches 
  will simulate a testing environment to make you feel more comfortable in testing 
  situations and offer practical advice on how to overcome your test apprehension. 
  Test anxiety affects many students and can seem overwhelming when studying for 
  a standardized test&#8212;let trained professionals help. Making sure to have 
  a <a href="../silent_timer/index.php">test timer</a> for your exam is also extremely 
  important to curbing your test anxiety. There is nothing worse than worrying 
  you will not have <a href="../timemanagement/index.php">enough time</a> to finish 
  your test or test section.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Price<br>
  </strong>Prep courses range anywhere from free on up to one thousand dollars. 
  <a href="http://number2.com" target="_blank"> Number2.com</a> offers an interactive 
  online course free, while <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com" target="_blank"> 
  The Princeton Review</a> and <a href="http://www.kaptest.com">Kaplan Test Prep 
  and Admissions</a> both offer free mini courses. Though some prep courses are 
  indeed free, a worthwhile prep course with true educational value and in-depth 
  training will lie on the higher end of the cost spectrum. The better the course, 
  the more you pay. Think of it as an investment, a couple thousand dollars spent 
  preparing you for a VERY important test will pay back a hundred fold in the 
  long run. Imagine scoring in the 90th percentile after taking a preparation 
  course, then becoming a successful lawyer making $1 million dollars a year. 
  If you had scored in the 60th percentile, you wouldn't have gotten into that 
  good law school or scored that job with a top firm. So, regardless of price, 
  do what you think will be best for your FUTURE.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prep courses are not the 
  only way to <a href="../increasescores/index.php"> increase your score</a>. 
  Make sure to invest in several test books and read them thoroughly to get an 
  idea of what your test is about.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Practice Tests</strong><br>
  One of the most important things a prep course will bring you is many practice 
  tests. The MOST important aspect of learning your test and how to beat it will 
  be to take it over and over and over until you are completely familiar with 
  it. Get your hands on as many tests as possible.</font></p>
