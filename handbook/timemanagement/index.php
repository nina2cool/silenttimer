<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whoever said that procrastination 
  is the thief of time knew what they were talking about. It&#8217;s the worst 
  enemy of students everywhere. With temptations like friends, television, the 
  Internet and sleep, it can be very easy to lose track of your goals and other 
  priorities, like studying. <strong>Good time management</strong> will be what 
  <em><font color="#FF0000"><strong>makes</strong></font></em> or <strong><em><font color="#FF0000">breaks</font></em></strong> 
  a student's chances of success when taking an entrance exam.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Time management 
  is absolutely necessary when studying for any kind of test</em></strong>. It 
  will not only help you achieve your goals when learning material, but it will 
  also be a <font color="#FF0000" size="3"><strong><em>significant factor in increasing 
  your scores</em></strong></font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before you even begin to 
  think about raising your scores to genius level, you must set both short term 
  and long term goals. <br>
  <strong><br>
  <font color="#003399">Time Management Tip #1:</font></strong> Plan where you 
  want your score to be at a specific points in time- in a week, a month, a year. 
  This way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about increasing your entire test score 
  by 200 points at one time. Instead, you can work toward improving your practice 
  test score by small increments each week or each month. Little by little keeps 
  you sane. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#003399">Time 
  Management Tip #2:</font></strong><font color="#003399"> </font>Decide when 
  is the best time for you to study and for how long. One of the most important 
  steps in test preparation is to recognize your own habits. If you find you are 
  too tired in the mornings to absorb any information, try studying in the early 
  afternoon after you&#8217;ve had a chance to be active and your mind&#8217;s 
  a little more awake. Whenever you find that time in the day when you are most 
  apt to learn and be able to recall information, set that portion of the day 
  as your official study time. Let your friends and family know that time as well 
  so they won&#8217;t distract you during this time period. Using the same study 
  hours everyday will force you into a routine schedule where you won&#8217;t 
  be able to come up with excuses about why you don&#8217;t have time to study.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you have set your study 
  hours, be sure not to stress yourself out by scheduling marathon study sessions. 
  Your mind needs a break every once in a while! Every hour or two, get up to 
  stretch and walk around for 10 to 20 minutes. It is more efficient to study 
  hard for a set amount of time and take a short break, than attempt to study 
  for hours on end. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where you study can also 
  affect how you manage your study time. How do you possibly expect to get any 
  studying done if you choose a place where the phone is constantly ringing or 
  your neighbor&#8217;s heavy metal music is loud enough to bust anyone&#8217;s 
  eardrums within 100 feet of his stereo? Choose a study area that is free of 
  distractions. Yes, this includes prying yourself away from a computer with Internet 
  access if possible. You can check e-mail and your favorite teams&#8217; scores 
  during your break. A regular study area free of distractions will clear your 
  mind of floating thoughts and interruptions, allowing you to properly train 
  yourself for the upcoming exam. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Good time management 
  also needs to be practiced when actually taking a test</strong>. These skills 
  will almost certainly help to increase your scores by recognizing <em><strong>when 
  to spend time on a question and when to move o</strong></em><strong><em>n</em></strong>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#003399">Time 
  Management Tip #3:</font></strong> The general rule of thumb is to answer the 
  easiest questions first and return to the more difficult questions later. Don&#8217;t 
  waste time trying to figure out one question that you know you could figure 
  out if you only had more time. Make the best of your time by earning the points 
  you deserve on the easy questions. At least ensure those points. <strong>You&#8217;d 
  hate to find out later that your answer to the impossible question was incorrect 
  when you <font color="#0000FF"><em>could&#8217;ve answered 10 easier questions 
  later in the test</em></font></strong>. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be sure to know the rules 
  of the particular exam you are taking to know exactly how to utilize your time 
  on each question. For example, computer-adaptive tests will not allow you to 
  skip a question. In this situation, instead of answering the easiest questions 
  first and returning to the difficult ones later, you will have to improve your 
  skills in making educated guesses. </font></p>
