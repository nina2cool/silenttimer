        INVENTS SILENT TIMER DESIGNED<br>
    SPECIFICALLY FOR STANDARDIZED TESTS</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Erik McMillan uses his own experience to create innovative product for
    test takers</i></b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      WHAT:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the
        age of twenty four, Erik McMillan has already sold his invention, The
        Silent Timer&trade;, to students in the
        US, Canada and ten other countries worldwide. He now has a patent pending
        on the only testing timer on the market made specifically for standardized
    test takers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McMillan
      first began designing the timer in 2002 while preparing for the June Law
      School Admission Test. Like many other standardized tests, the LSAT is
      timed. This adds to the test&rsquo;s level of difficulty, making
    pacing a major concern for many students.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;I knew that I could increase
      my score through timed practice,&rdquo; said
      McMillan, &ldquo;but there were no timers out there that I could practice
    with and use on test day&hellip;so I made one myself.&rdquo;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Standardized
      examination boards allow only a limited variety of timing devices to enter
      the exam room; timers and watches with an audible alarm are strictly prohibited.
      In the past, students have clipped wires in watches and kitchen timers
      to make them &ldquo;legal&rdquo; for test day. McMillan&rsquo;s
      Silent Timer&trade; offers a unique solution for test takers: it is completely
    silent and equipped with unique features that help improve pacing.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McMillan
      is now developing a newer version of his timer to be sold later this year. &ldquo;I
      am always looking for feedback and new ideas from students,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in their shoes, and I&rsquo;m willing to add
    new features along the way if it will ease some of that test anxiety.&rdquo;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT
    ELSE:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Erik McMillan
        is a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin and CEO of Silent
        Technology LLC. His invention, The Silent Timer&trade;,
      is designed to help students improve their performance on standardized
      exams through better timing. The timer is offered on the company Web site
      (<a href="http://www.silenttimer.com/" target="_blank">www.SilentTimer.com</a>) and in retail stores such as Barnes and Noble College.
