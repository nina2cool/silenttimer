<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Austin is known for its successful start-up companies, and now two entrepreneurs
      from the Capital City have been named by INC magazine as the top 30 in the
nation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They have a product designed for anyone taking a test.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The <a href="http://www.silenttimer.com/" target="_blank">Silent Timer</a> is
    a device to help students score higher on any standardized test or any test
    that's timed really," Erik McMillan, CEO of Silent Technology, said.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether you're studying for the GMAT or the GRE, the Silent Timer may be
    your key to a higher score.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
    The idea for it came from Erik when he was studying for the LSATs. He wanted
    a timer that didn't make noise to bring into the test, but couldn't find
    one.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It snapped in my head, and I said, 'everyone is looking for these things,
    including me, and there's nothing out there,'" Erik said.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So he cut out the speakers in other timers and started selling them for
    a profit.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And it just grew from there," Erik
  said.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, his wife, Christina, will tell you success did not come overnight.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We drew up the schematics and stuff, but it's like, OK, how do you actually
    make this thing? Erik actually Googled our manufacturer online and found
    him, and it worked out and went through prototype after prototype," Christina
    said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
    The prototype they settled on works like this.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You enter the number of questions on your test, and you enter in the amount
    of time on your test. After you finish the question, there is a red button
    on top, kind of like a chess game. You just tap it, and then it recalculates
    all your time," Erik said. "And after each question, if you spend too much
    time, it'll kind of just flash like three times, and it's right out of the
    corner of your eye. The last full minute, it just flashes the whole time."<br>
&nbsp;<br>
    The invention landed them in INC magazine as the top 30 under 30 entrepreneurs
    in the country.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the young age of 25, this couple has aced their test for success with
    the silent timer.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's been a long process but very rewarding," Christina
  said.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Right now, the silent timer is being sold in 500 retail stores nationwide
    for $29.95.</font></p>
