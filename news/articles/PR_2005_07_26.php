    WHAT: </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First
        time exhibitor Silent Technology LLC drew hundreds of curious eyes as
        it showcased its unique classroom time management tool, The Silent Timer&trade;.
        The product sold out during the three day Conference for the Advancement
    of Mathematics Teaching (CAMT) in Dallas, July 11-13.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Over
        6,000 people attended the CAMT this year. Most of them were math teachers,
        looking for new tools and ideas to apply to their curriculum. While browsing
        almost 200 booths at the conference, many teachers stopped at The Silent
        Timer&trade; exhibit to learn more about
    a solution to a major classroom concern: time management.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many educators
      attribute lowered test scores and unproductive class sessions to poor timing.
      The Silent Timer&trade; offers a unique solution for both
      teachers and students. Students take advantage of its testing features
      to pace themselves on tests and quizzes; teachers utilize it to better
      manage their lesson plans. The Silent Timer&trade;, as its name suggests,
    is also completely silent and unobtrusive in the quiet classroom setting.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;What
      attracts teachers to this product is its versatility,&rdquo; said
      Erik McMillan, inventor of The Silent Timer&trade;. &ldquo;Some use it
      for students with learning disabilities, while others use it to prepare
      their classes for important standardized tests such as the AP or SAT. Either
      way, students benefit.&rdquo;<br>
    </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT ELSE:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Silent
        Timer&trade; is
        designed to help students improve their performance on classroom tests
        and standardized exams through better timing. The Timer is offered on
        the company Web site (<a href="http://www.silenttimer.com/" target="_blank">www.SilentTimer.com</a>) and in retail stores such
        as Barnes and Noble College and Borders. For more information, please
