<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WHAT:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just
          two years after The Silent Timer&trade;&rsquo;s debut in the
        test prep market, 
  Barnes &amp; Noble College and Borders Books have stocked the product in 297
      of their retail locations nationwide. As of August 15, 2005, students on
  every campus with a Barnes and Noble College bookstore will have the option
  of purchasing The Silent Timer&trade; locally, in addition to purchasing online. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Silent Timer&trade; has become a popular product among both instructors
    and the students they teach. Because it is silent and equipped with unique
    pacing features, test preparation companies such as Gorilla Test Prep now consider
    the Timer to be an &ldquo;integral part&rdquo; of their courses. Students
    are also spreading the word to their peers- through classes, online forums,
and word-of-mouth recommendations. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Borders Books and Barnes &amp; Noble
      College are taking advantage of the buzz, stocking up for the next big
  exam: the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) on October 1st. </font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;Before the June administration of the LSAT, students were constantly
  calling to let us know that their bookstores were out of stock,&rdquo; said
  Christina McMillan, VP of Silent Technology LLC. &ldquo;The addition of new
  stores will be more convenient for students, especially those making last minute
  purchases before their exams. We&rsquo;re preparing for record sales this September.&rdquo;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WHAT ELSE:</font></p>
