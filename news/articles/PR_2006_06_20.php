          <I><b>The Silent Timer&#8482; will now be bundled with a simpler timer for test
  day.</b></I><b></FONT></FONT></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WHAT:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beginning
            in July 2006, Silent Technology LLC will include a more basic timer
          alongside The Silent Timer&#8482;, its already popular
                pacing tool for standardized test takers.<BR>
    <BR>
    The bonus timer is being included as a safeguard for test day,
especially for those taking the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT).
As it currently stands, some proctors feel that The Silent Timer&#8482; could
      give test takers an unfair advantage with its unique pacing features. The
      bonus timer is simple enough to allow students to keep track of time without
      raising the suspicions of overly cautious proctors. It is completely silent,
      has a large LCD readout, and counts both up and down.<BR>
    <BR>
    Silent Technology LLC continues to emphasize the importance of practicing
    with The Silent Timer&#8482;, as it helps students develop the internal pacing
      clock that is the key to effective test time management. After solidifying
      their sense of timing, they will be ready to move steadily through their
      exam using only a simple timer as a guide.<BR>
    <BR>
&rdquo;We considered the idea of just offering a simple, silent countdown timer,&rdquo; says
      Erik McMillan, inventor and CEO. &ldquo;This simplification, however, brings
      us back to the original problem- test takers do not have the necessary skills
      to pace themselves. The extra features on The Silent Timer are intended to
      help them learn these skills.&rdquo; <BR>
    <BR>
    The bundled package will be offered at the same price as the current Silent
    Timer. Silent Technology LLC is confident that consumers will see the true
    value of the new combination- for practice and test day.<BR>
